# Home base for looking at correlation between derived weather variables and recorded hardiness 
# Do not summarize data in this, only good for visualizing. Honestly might be better to put this into /viz

# NOTE: Hardiness recordings are bimonthly. Weather metrics must summarize data between recordings (roughly 14 days).
#       Keep that in mind with the following metrics...

# Weather Metrics in Question
## 14 day average (tmin, tmax, and average)
## Cooling Degree Days (CDD) (vary threshold temps?)
## precipitation 
## sunny days
## cloudy days
## days past Aug 1st
## photoperiod (simple daylight calculation or include cloudy / sunny in some model)

# Comparisons
## Metrics by variety
## Metrics by samples in acclimation
## Metrics by samples in deep dormancy
## Metrics by samples in deacclimation
